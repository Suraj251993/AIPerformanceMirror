Employee Activity Performance App — End-to-End Guideline

Purpose: A developer-ready, end-to-end guideline you can paste into Replit AI Builder to help build a 2-role application (HR and Employee/Manager) that pulls activity data from Zoho Projects and Zoho Sprints and evaluates employees’ performance in near real-time. UI should be modern, catchy, with 3D elements and a dark-blue theme.

1. Project Summary

Goal: Build a web application that:

Integrates with Zoho Projects and Zoho Sprints to ingest daily task/activity data.

Provides two main login experiences: HR portal (org‑wide visibility) and Employee/Manager portal (self and team views).

Computes a real‑time performance score per employee and per team, displayed via engaging 3D/dark‑blue dashboards.

Includes feedback capture that contributes to performance scoring.

Primary stakeholders: HR, People Ops, Engineering Managers, Individual Contributors, Product/Program Managers.

Tech stack (recommended):

Frontend: React (Vite or Next.js), Tailwind CSS, Three.js / React Three Fiber for 3D elements.

Backend: Node.js + Express or Fastify, or Python Flask/FastAPI.

Database: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching/real‑time), optional timeseries DB (InfluxDB) for activity logs.

Integration: Zoho Projects API, Zoho Sprints API (OAuth2), Webhooks if available.

Hosting / Deployment: Replit for initial development; Docker + cloud provider (GCP/AWS) for production.

2. Core Requirements (Functional)

Authentication & Authorization

OAuth2 login for Zoho integration (per user / per org token model).

App-level auth: sign-in via company SSO (optional), or standard email/password + 2FA.

Role-based access: HR_ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE.

Data Ingestion

Pull tasks, time logs, comments, status changes, story points, and sprint assignments from Zoho Projects and Zoho Sprints.

Support both scheduled pulls (cron every X minutes) and webhook-driven updates (real-time when Zoho supports webhooks).

Dashboard & Views

HR Dashboard: org-wide KPIs, department heatmaps, individual scorecards, trend views, export (CSV/PDF).

Manager Dashboard: team member activity list, team score, daily/weekly summary, alerts for underperformance.

Employee View: personal activity timeline, current score, feedback received, suggested improvements.

Performance Scoring Engine

Combine objective signals (task completes, time logged, SLA adherence, velocity) + subjective inputs (feedback) into a score.

Feedback Module

Allow peers/managers/HR to give feedback with numeric rating + short comment.

Feedback contributes a configurable % weight to the overall score.

Reporting & Exports

Daily email summary (optional), weekly report to managers and HR.

CSV/PDF exports for audits and reviews.

Privacy & Compliance

Data retention controls, role-based masking of PII, GDPR/PDPA consideration as needed.

3. Non-functional Requirements

Real-time-ish: data should be updated within configurable window (e.g., 5–15 minutes) depending on webhooks and rate limits.

Scalable: support thousands of employees; use background workers for ingestion and scoring.

Secure: encrypted tokens, least privilege, audit logs for data access.

Usable & Attractive: modern 3D visual accents but performant on standard workstations.

4. Integration Design (Zoho Projects & Sprints)
4.1 Authentication to Zoho

Use OAuth2 with Zoho; request scopes: projects.read, sprints.read (or equivalent). Store refresh tokens encrypted.

4.2 Data to Pull

From Zoho Projects: tasks (id, title, assignee, status, start/end dates, time logs, comments), milestones, custom fields.

From Zoho Sprints: user stories, issues, sprint membership, estimation points, status transitions, comments.

Other signals: attachments added, comments, time spent entries.

4.3 Data Sync Strategies

Webhooks (preferred): subscribe to task events -> process in webhook consumer endpoint.

Polling (fallback): cron jobs that call Zoho APIs with modified_after timestamps to fetch deltas.

4.4 Rate Limiting & Error Handling

Build exponential backoff and retry. Track API quota; batch requests where possible.

5. Data Model (high-level)

Tables (Postgres)

users (id, name, email, role, zoho_user_id, org_id, manager_id, created_at)

orgs (id, name, zoho_oauth_token*, token_expiry, refresh_token_encrypted)

projects (id, org_id, zoho_project_id, name)

tasks (id, project_id, zoho_task_id, title, assignee_id, status, points, created_at, updated_at)

time_logs (id, task_id, user_id, minutes, logged_at)

activity_events (id, user_id, source_type, payload_json, event_time)

feedback (id, from_user_id, to_user_id, rating, comment, created_at)

scores (id, user_id, date, score_value, components_json)

audit_logs (id, user_id, action, target, created_at)

*Store OAuth tokens encrypted using KMS or env-key.

6. Performance Scoring (recommended approach)

Design principles: transparent, configurable, explainable.

6.1 Signals & Weights (example)

Task Completion Rate: 30%

Timeliness (met deadlines): 20%

Time Logged vs Estimate (efficiency): 10%

Sprint Velocity / Story Points closed: 15%

Collaboration (comments, PR/issue comments): 5%

Feedback Score (peer & manager): 20% (configurable)

Weights must be configurable by HR.

6.2 Aggregation

Compute normalized sub-scores (0–100) for each signal per day.

Multiply by weights and sum to get total daily score.

Keep rolling window (7d, 30d) averages for trend and smoothing.

6.3 Example pseudocode
for each user:
  task_score = normalize(tasks_completed_today / tasks_assigned_today)
  timeliness_score = normalize(percent_tasks_on_time)
  feedback_score = average(feedback_ratings_last_30_days)
  total = sum(weight_i * signal_i)
  persist to scores table
7. Feedback Module Details

Feedback form: rating (1-5), category (communication, delivery, collaboration), comment.

Admin controls to configure how much weight feedback contributes to total score.

Optional anonymity toggle with auditability (audit logs still record origin for HR).

8. UI/UX Guidelines (design language)

Theme: Dark Blue primary palette (suggested hexs: #0B1F3A dark, #123B6A, #1E6FB8 accent, #0E2940 background). Use high contrast white/soft-gray text.

3D Elements:

Use subtle 3D widgets made with React Three Fiber: floating KPI cards, orbiting data nodes, layered depth in hero banner.

Avoid heavy scenes; keep 3D simple to preserve performance (e.g., soft shadows, extruded card effects, glassmorphism panels).

Typography & Spacing:

Clean sans-serif (Inter or Poppins). Large headline (xl), readable body (base), comfortable padding (p-4 / p-6).

Components & Pages:

Login / OAuth screen

HR Dashboard (org metrics, heatmap, table of employees)

Manager Dashboard (team list, alerts)

Employee Profile (activity timeline, score history, feedback)

Score Details modal (show breakdown of components)

Admin settings (weight configuration, retention, integrations)

Microinteractions: use subtle motion on hover and card entrance. Use Framer Motion for smooth transitions.

9. API Design (sample endpoints)

Auth

POST /api/auth/login — app login

GET /api/auth/zoho/oauth — redirect to Zoho OAuth

GET /api/auth/zoho/callback — handle Zoho callback

Users

GET /api/users/:id — get profile

GET /api/users/:id/activities?from=&to= — activity timeline

Ingest

POST /api/ingest/webhook/zoho — webhook consumer

POST /api/ingest/poll — manual poll endpoint

Scores

GET /api/scores/:userId?from=&to= — scores for user

POST /api/scores/recompute — re-run scoring (admin)

Feedback

POST /api/feedback — submit feedback

GET /api/feedback/to/:userId — list feedback received

All endpoints must enforce role checks and rate limits.

10. Security & Privacy

Encrypt tokens at rest. Use HTTPS/TLS.

Role-based access enforcement.

Audit logs for data access and administrative changes.

Data retention policy: default 1 year for detailed activity; aggregated scores keep longer.

Compliance: identify applicable laws (GDPR, PDPA Malaysia) and provide user data export & deletion flows.

11. Testing Strategy

Unit tests for scoring logic (critical). Use Jest (JS) or Pytest (Python).

Integration tests for Zoho API connectors (mock Zoho responses).

E2E tests for UI flows (Cypress/Playwright).

Load tests for ingestion pipeline (k6).

12. Deployment & Replit Instructions (quick start)

1) Replit dev setup (recommended for prototypes):

Create a new Replit (Node/React template). Add .env keys for DATABASE_URL, ZOHO_CLIENT_ID, ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET, JWT_SECRET.

Install server dependencies (express, axios, pg) and client deps (react, tailwindcss, react-three-fiber, framer-motion).

Add a webhook route exposed publicly via Replit URL for Zoho webhooks (use a staging org/test project in Zoho).

2) Local run commands

npm install

npm run dev (frontend + backend concurrently)

3) Persistence

Use Replit DB for quick prototyping or connect to managed Postgres via external connection string.

4) Environment & Secrets

Securely store OAuth secrets in Replit secrets. Rotate periodically.

13. MVP Roadmap & Backlog (suggested sprint plan)

Sprint 0 (setup): project skeleton, auth, basic UI theme, DB

Sprint 1 (integrations): Zoho OAuth + polling, ingest tasks into DB

Sprint 2 (scoring & dashboards): basic scoring engine, employee page, manager page

Sprint 3 (feedback & HR views): feedback module, HR dashboard, export

Sprint 4 (polish): 3D UX additions, admin settings, testing & monitoring

14. Acceptance Criteria (examples)

HR can view any employee's score and drill into last 30 days activities.

Manager can view their team members and receive alerts when a member's daily score drops below threshold.

App ingests a task update from Zoho and the affected user's score updates within the configured window (e.g., 10 min).

Feedback submitted by a manager appears in the employee's profile and influences the next scoring cycle.
