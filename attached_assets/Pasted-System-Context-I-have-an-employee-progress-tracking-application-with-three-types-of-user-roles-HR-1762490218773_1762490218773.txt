System Context:
I have an employee progress tracking application with three types of user roles:

HR – Access to all employees’ day-to-day activities.

Project Manager/Product Manager – Access to their own team members only.

Employee – Access to their own daily task progress and status.

Objective:
Integrate and align the provided dataset with the application’s data model to visualize realistic performance and progress dashboards for each user type.

Dataset Columns:

Task Name

Associated Team

Owner

Custom Status

Tags

Start Date

Due Date

Duration

Priority

Created By

% Completed

Completion Date

Work Hours

Billing Type

Instructions for the AI Builder:

1. Schema Alignment

Map the dataset fields to the app’s internal data entities as follows:

Task Name → Task_Title

Associated Team → Team_Name

Owner → Employee_Name(s) / Employee_ID(s)

Custom Status → Task_Status

Tags → Task_Tags

Start Date → Task_Start_Date

Due Date → Task_End_Date

Duration → Estimated_Duration (days or hours)

Priority → Task_Priority

Created By → Created_By_User

% Completed → Progress_Percentage

Completion Date → Task_Completion_Date

Work Hours → Actual_Worked_Hours

Billing Type → Billing_Category

2. Access Logic

HR View:

Access all data across teams and projects.

Filters: Employee, Team, Project, Date Range.

Project Manager View:

Access limited to their assigned Associated Team.

Dashboard: Team progress summary, overdue tasks, and average performance score.

Employee View:

View only records where the logged-in user is listed as Owner (even if multiple owners exist).

Dashboard:

Individual progress (based on tasks owned or co-owned).

Completion status, work hours, and recent task activity.

3. Group Ownership Logic

Allow the Owner field to contain multiple users (group of people) for shared tasks.

The system should:

Split group tasks internally so each member gets an individual performance record.

Track each person’s contribution through metrics like:

Individual work hours

Subtask completion status

% Completed (individual vs collective)

Calculate individual performance scores by factoring in:

Task weight (priority or duration)

Share of work hours contributed

Timeliness (based on due vs completion date)

Reflect this data on both HR and PM dashboards for evaluation.

4. Visualization Requirements

HR Dashboard: Organization-wide overview

Task completion rate trends

Top-performing employees

Overdue vs completed tasks

Team comparison chart

Project Manager Dashboard:

Team performance summary

Individual member contribution

Upcoming deadlines

Total work hours & average progress %

Employee Dashboard:

Personal progress bar

List of assigned and co-owned tasks

Task completion trend chart

Work hours logged vs estimated duration

5. Data Simulation

Fill missing values with realistic defaults.

Use Start Date, Due Date, and % Completed to compute live task progress.

Flag overdue tasks automatically (Current Date > Due Date & % Completed < 100).

6. Validation

Ensure all date formats follow ISO standard (YYYY-MM-DD).

Verify that team and ownership mappings are correct.

Validate that group tasks still contribute to individual performance tracking.

7. Demo Readiness

Create mock login states for HR, Project Manager, and Employee.

Simulate dashboards using this dataset.

Confirm smooth navigation between user types and accurate data filtering.

✅ Outcome Expected:
A working demo where:

Each user role sees filtered and relevant dashboards.

Group-owned tasks still feed into each employee’s personal performance score.

HR and PM dashboards reflect combined and individual productivity metrics accurately.
